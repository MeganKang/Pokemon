Pokemon Game
A text-based game written in Java that simulates the popular nintendo game Pokemon. 
The code starts off with asking what the player's name is and give you a starter pokemon.
Once chosen, a display menu of the players health, money, potions, pokeballs and pokemon are shown.
A map is provided below and the user is given options to go in either direction, moving them through
the map.
They will encounter random pokemon, hospital spots, and shops (however these things are hidden until
they go through the map).
